## Chapter1 - Introduction (It's All About Complexity)



> As a program evolves and acquires more features, it becomes complicated, with subtle dependencies between its components.

This is the lifecycle of software products. It starts simple and becomes complicated as it evolves. This is a natural process. 


> Over time, complexity accumulates, and it becomes harder and harder for programmers to keep all of the relevant factors in their minds as they modify the system. This slows down development and leads to bugs, which slow development even more and add to its cost. Complexity increases inevitably over the life of any program.

This is inevitable but problematic. I feel daily basis in my software development. As the softare products life cycle are never ended, the complexity is never ended. Those two are a BIG TWO to approach.
- Making us slower
- Making us more buggy

According to the author, there two approaches to deal with the complexity. The first one is to eliminate it. The second one is to encapsulate it.

  - The second approach is called as moduler design. In modular design, 
    - software is divided into modules.
    - modules are designed to be relatively independent of each other.
    - so that, a programmer can work on one module without having to understand the details of other modules.
         

This book will discuss about
- what is complexity
- why does it matter
- how can we recognize it
and more challengingly,
- techniques for minimizing complexity
